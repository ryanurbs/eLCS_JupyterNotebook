    "It has the core elements of the functionality that help define the concept of LCSs. It’s the same family as the fully featured ExSTraCS system, so it is easy to transfer to a state-of-the-art LCS from this shallow learning curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "eLCS complements the forthcoming *Textbook on Learning Classifier Systems*. Each demo is paired with one of the chapters in the textbook. Therefore, there are 5 different versions of an educational learning classiﬁer system (eLCS), as relevant functionality (code) is added to eLCS at each stage. This builds up the eLCS algorithm in its entirety from Demo 1 through to 5. Demo 6 showcases how ExSTraCS may be applied to a real-world data mining example, i.e. large scale bioinformatics. "

    "All code is in Python. This newest version is coded in Python 3.4. Here it is to be run in the Jupyter platform (http://jupyter.org/), as it supports interactive data science. <p style=\"color:lightgrey;\">[Note eLCS was originally coded in Eclipse using PyDev 2.7, which is still valid and available on request from Ryan, although Python 2+ code will not function in Python 3+. Alternatively, each version may be run by calling eLCS Run.py.].</p> \n",
